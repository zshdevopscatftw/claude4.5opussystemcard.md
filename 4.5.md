### ASL-3 Deployment
- Does **not** trigger ASL-4 thresholds (CBRN-4, AI R&D-4, cyber-4, autonomy-4)
- Approaching autonomy proxy thresholds but still requires heavy human oversight
- Lowest misalignment rates ever measured on a frontier model

### Major New Features
- **Extended Thinking + “effort” parameter** – dynamically scales reasoning tokens
- **Tool clearing & 1M token memory tool** – BrowseComp-Plus: 72.89% with memory
- **Multi-agent orchestration** – 87% on internal retrieval benchmark
- **MCP Atlas, CyberGym, FinanceAgent, SpreadsheetBench** – all new SOTA

### Safety & Alignment Summary
- **Single-turn harmlessness**: 99.78% (near-perfect across 6 languages)
- **Over-refusal rate**: 0.23% (best-in-class)
- **Multi-turn & ambiguous context**: strongest ever shipped
- **Misalignment propensity**: lowest measured on any frontier model to date
- **Sabotage / hidden goals**: dramatically reduced vs Opus 4 / Sonnet 4.5

### Notable Quotes from the Card
> “Claude Opus 4.5 is the most robustly aligned model released to date, likely the best-aligned frontier model by any developer.”

> “Even with safeguards removed, the model shows dramatically lower rates of misaligned behavior than previous generations.”
